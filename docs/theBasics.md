# The Basics

## Written using JSX

### Data Structure

Immutable Styles are represented using a [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) ‚Äì the same data structure as HTML ‚Äì and are written using JSX (like React). Here is an immutable style in its simplest form:

```jsx
<h1>
  font-family: "Operator Mono";
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 2rem;
</h1>
```

The example above is the equivalant of a CSS ruleset. It consists of a *selector* ‚Äì in this case the `h1` tag, and contains three CSS declarations: `font-family`, `font-weight` and `font-size`. In immutable styles this is known as an **immutable ruleset**.

An immutable ruleset can contain other immutable rulesets:

```jsx
<dl>
  <dt>
    flex-basis: 50%;
  </dt>
</dl>
```

The example above equates to a CSS ruleset that consists of two selectors. The `flex-basis` declaration will apply to elements matching the second selector ‚Äì the `dt` tag *only* when the ancestor element matches the first selector ‚Äì the `dl` tag. This is the equivalant of a CSS *decendant selector*.

An immutable ruleset can contain *both* CSS declarations and other immutable rulesets:

```jsx
<dl>
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  <dt>
    flex-basis: 50%;
  </dt>
</dl>
```

The example above includes CSS declarations for both the first selector ‚Äì the `dl` tag ‚Äì and the second selector ‚Äì the `dt` tag. As with CSS there is no limit to the number of decendants in a given selector. In the example above the second ruleset could contain a thrid ruleset, which in turn could contain a forth ruleset, and so on:

```jsx
<dl>
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  <dt>
    flex-basis: 50%;
    <span>
      text-transform: uppercase;
    </span>
  </dt>
</dl>
```

### JSX Attributes

So far we've only seen *type selectors* ‚Äì selectors that match elements by their HTML tag name. However it is common for CSS selectors to match elements based on a specific class name, pseudo class/element, and or screen-size.

In immutable styles these are achieved using JSX attributtes. Similar to props in React ‚Äì immutable attributtes are defined on the opening JSX tag.

**`className`**

```jsx
<div className="side-bar">
  height: 100%;
  overflow auto;
</div>
```

The example above is the equivalant of a CSS ruleset whose *selector* matches HTML elements of type `div` *and* have the class `side-bar`.

**`pseudo`**

```jsx
<a pseudo=":hover">
  color: darkblue;
</a>
```

The example above is the equivalant of a CSS selector using the *pseudo-class* keyword that matches HTML elements of type `a` in a specific state ‚Äì in this case `hover`.

Likewise the `pseudo` attribute is also used for *pseudo-elements* :

```jsx
<span pseudo="::before">
  content: "üêπ";
</span>
```

> üí°Note: the `pseudo` JSX attribute supports both CSS2 (`:before`) and CSS3 (`::before`) syntax.

**`minWidth`**

```jsx
<body minWidth="900">
  font-size: 1rem;
</body>
```

The example above is the equivalant of a CSS ruleset defined within a `media-query`. In this case the selector targets the HTML element `body` on screen-sizes wider than 900px.

**`maxWidth`**

```jsx
<body maxWidth="350">
  font-size: 1.4rem;
</body>
```

The example above is the equivalant of a CSS *media-query* targeting screens less than 350px wide.

> üí°Note: the unit for media-queries is predefined by immutable styles ‚Äì all media queries default to pixels ‚Äì where `maxWidth="350"` equates to 350px.

> üîÆ Supporting units other than pixels is something that could be added in future.

<p align="center">*</p>

Any combination of JSX attributes can be used together:

```jsx
<div className="side-bar" minWidth="350">
  background: ivory;
  <span className="icon">
    color: magenta;
  </span>
  <span className="icon" pseudo=":hover">
    color: darkmagenta;
  </span>
</div>
```

The example above features the `className`, `minWidth` and `pseudo` JSX attributes. On screens wider than 350px HTML elements of type `div` with the class `side-bar` will have an ivory background color.

On screens wider than 350px HTML elements of type `span` ‚Äì with the class `icon` ‚Äì whose ancestor is a `div` with the class `side-bar` will be the color magenta. On `hover` the same icon color will change to darkmagenta.

> üí°Note: it should be noted that *unlike* props in React ‚Äì only JSX attributes predefined by immutable styles are allowed.

### üö´ No Overrides Allowed

> üí°Note: if you haven't already, I strongly reccommend reading [The case for Immutable Styles]() and the post [CSS Overrides: Friend or Foe?]() before reading this section.

Until now we have only observed the similarieties between immutable styles and CSS ‚Äì the only difference *so far* being immutable styles are written using JSX.

There are however some major differences between immutable styles and CSS ‚Äì most of which fall under the umbrella goal of **preventing CSS overrides**.

The key difference is that immutable styles are *compiled*. Just like Elms compiler prevents runtime errors in JavaScript, the immutable styles compiler prevents *runtime* overrides in CSS.

> üìñ A runtime override happens when two or more rulesets containing conflicting declarations target the same element.

#### An Example

Imagine a designer has provided a styleguide that shows all primary buttons *should* look like this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../docs/_images/PrimaryButton.png"
    width="710px"
    height="210px"
    alt="Screenshot of primary button"
    title="Screenshot of primary button"
  />
</p>

In conventional CSS the ruleset would be:

```css
.btn-primary {
  padding: 10px 30px;
  border: 1px solid #3B7AC9;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  background: #4A96F8;
  color: #FFFFFF;
}
```

The equivalant immutable ruleset would be almost identical:

```jsx
<button className="btn-primary">
  padding: 10px 30px;
  border: 1px solid #3B7AC9;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  background: #4A96F8;
  color: #FFFFFF;
</button>
```

Whilst semantically similar ‚Äì the *behaviour* of each ruleset is different. The CSS ruleset is vulnerable to both intentional and unintensional overrides:

```css
.promo .btn-primary {
  background: ivory;
  color: cornflowerblue;
}
```

The example above modifies the background and text color of primary buttons inside elements with the class `promo`. Whilst being perfectly valid CSS this *invalidates* the design principle ‚Äì in this case ‚Äì that all primary buttons should have a `cornflowerblue` background and `ivory` color.

It therefore cannot be *guaranteed* that all primary buttons will look the same ‚Äì which in effect makes the designers styleguide more a suggestion than a gospel truth.

> üí°Note: this leads to an inconsistant UI and an unhappy designer. It also creates technical debt ‚Äì where two versions of primary buttons need maintaining.

Attempting the same in immutable styes yeilds a different result. Overriding an immutable ruleset is not allowed:

```jsx
<div className="promo">
  <button className="btn-primary">
    background: ivory;
    color: cornflower;
  </button>
</div>
```

Modifying the background and text color of primary buttons inside elements with the class `promo` throws a compile time error:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../docs/_images/PrimaryButtonOverrideFound.png"
    width="785px"
    height="430px"
    alt="Screenshot of primary button override compile time error"
    title="Screenshot of primary button override compile time error"
  />
</p>

The compiler makes overriding styles impossible. Overrides are caught and prevented ahead of time. Compile time errors ‚Äì such as the case above ‚Äì are treated as failed builds, for which no CSS is generated. CSS is only generated for successful builds ‚Äì those without compile time errors.

The immutable ruleset for primary buttons is therefore a gospel truth. It can be guaranteed that all primary buttons *will always* have a `cornflowerblue` background and `ivory` text color.

Whether attempted overrides happen in the same file or in another file ‚Äì among equal selectors or nested selectors ‚Äì or even among different screen-sizes, the immutable styles compiler catches them all. The complex task of detecting and preventing overrides is offloaded to a compiler ‚Äì and the burden of keeping track of overrides is no longer a developer concern.
