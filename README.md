# Immutable Styles
A JavaScript library for styling web interfaces with a focus on predictability and robustness. It uses immutability to remove side effects often tied to CSS.

### What is Immutable Styles?

Immutable Styles is a cross between a CSS pre-processor and a CSS in-JS library. Styles are written using JavaScript which are subsequently compiled to CSS. The library has 2 goals:

1. Make styles for the web **predictable**
2. Make styles for the web **robust**

If you have ever encountered styles that were neither expected nor desired you probably met a CSS side effect; most likely a consequence of:

- a) Selectors clashing with other selectors
- b) Selectors targeting unwanted elements
- c) Styles overriding other styles
- d) Elements inheriting undesirable styles

As the name suggests the library uses immutability to help remove these side effects. With Immutable Styles all CSS rules are immutable. An immutable style cannot change once created, which means it can **never** be overridden. This alone solves a, b and c (we will see the solution to d later).

## The case for Immutable Styles

Those familiar with CSS will have heard the term "winning style", in which styles compete against one another. Much of what makes CSS development difficult is ensuring the styles we want: win, and the styles we donâ€™t want: loose.

Overrides form the basis of "winning styles". CSS rules with the strongest specificity or endmost place in the cascade win. Anytime we edit a CSS file we risk changing the conditions that influence which overrides win. This makes CSS incredibly **fragile** and **unpredictable**.

Parallels can be drawn between mutable state in programs and overrides in CSS. When a style overrides another it mutates (changes) the value of the original style. Over recent years the front-end community has seen a huge shift towards removing mutable state in our applications - yet CSS has been left behind.

But why should the way we build applications be different to how we style them? We should unite construction with cosmetics. Immutable Styles is an attempt to remove mutation (a.k.a overrides) and thus complexity from CSS.

## Getting Started

### Install

Install Immutable Styles using npm:

`npm install immutable-styles`

Or with yarn:

`yarn add immutable-styles`

Then require it in any module:

`const { createStyle, createCSS } = require('immutable-styles');`

### Usage

Immutable Styles are written using functions. They are represented using the same data structure as the DOM - a tree. The library exposes two methods:

#### createStyle

Creates and returns the AST for an Immutable Style. This is the equivalent of a CSS rule-set.

`createStyle(element, attrs, ...children)`

**Parameters:**

**`element`** The HTML tag name, for example "div".

**`attrs`** Attributes if any, can be one of the following:

- *`className`* CSS class for the current element.
- *`minWidth`* Minimum width styles should apply. `minWidth: 900` is the equivalent of the CSS media query: `@media (min-width: 900px)`
- *`maxWidth`* Maximum width styles should apply. `maxWidth: 600` is the equivalent of the CSS media query: `@media (max-width: 600)`
- *`pseudo`* Pseudo classes and/or elements. `pseudo: ":hover"` is the equivalent of the psuedo selector: `:hover`

**`children`** Styles for the current element and/or nested child elements.

**Example:**

A simple rule-set:

```
--------------------------------------------------------
Immutable Styles          | Equivalent CSS
--------------------------------------------------------
                          |
createStyle(              |
 "p",                     | p {
 null,                    |  color: cadetblue;
 "color: cadetblue;"      | }
)                         |
                          |
--------------------------------------------------------
```

A rule-set with attributtes:

```
--------------------------------------------------------
Immutable Styles          | Equivalent CSS
--------------------------------------------------------
                          |
createStyle(              |
 "button",                | button.btn:hover {
 {                        |  opacity: 0.75;
   className: "btn",      | }
   pseudo: ":hover"       |
 },                       |
 "opacity: 0.75;"         |
)                         |
                          |
--------------------------------------------------------
```

A rule-set with child element:

```
--------------------------------------------------------
Immutable Styles          | Equivalent CSS
--------------------------------------------------------
                          |
createStyle(              |
 "section",               | section.row {
 {                        |  display: flex;
  className: "row"        | }
 },                       |
 "display: flex;",        | section.row div.col {
 createStyle(             |  flex: 1;
  "div",                  | }
  {                       |
    className: "col"      |
  },                      |
  "flex: 1;"              |
 )                        |
)                         |
                          |
--------------------------------------------------------
```

A rule-set with media query:

```
--------------------------------------------------------
Immutable Styles          | Equivalent CSS
--------------------------------------------------------
                          |
createStyle(              |
 "h1",                    | @media (max-width:680px) {
 {                        |  h1 {
  maxWidth: 680           |   font-size: 1.6em;
 },                       |  }
 "font-size: 1.6em;"      | }
)                         |
                          |
--------------------------------------------------------
```

#### createCSS

Takes the Immutable Styles AST returned from `createStyle` and turns it into CSS.

`createCSS(styles)`

**Parameter:**

**styles** The result returned from `createStyle`.

**Example:**

```js
// Define Immutable Styles
const styles = [
 createStyle(
  "p",
  null,
  "color: cadetblue;"
 ),
 createStyle(
  "button",
  {
   className: "btn",
   pseudo: ":hover"
  },
  "opacity: 0.75;"
 )
]

// Generate CSS
const CSS = createCSS(styles);
```
