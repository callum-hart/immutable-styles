# Resilient Runtime

The CSS generated by immutable styles is very resiliant to changes in HTML. This means adding or removing a class – using different class combinations – or changing the structure of HTML does not introduce previously non-exisitant overrides.

Lets look at an example of how changes in HTML usually affect what CSS rules apply, and how they can introduce new overrides:

```css
.title {
  color: blue;
}

.warning {
  color: red;
}
```

In the example above each CSS ruleset contains a `color` declaration. When each class is used independantly the color of the target element is predictable:

```html
<h1 class="title">I am blue</h1>
<h1 class="warning">I am red</h1>
```

When an element uses both classes one of the `color` declarations will override the other (depending on specificity, cascade or importance):

```html
<h1 class="title warning">In this case I am red</h1>
```

The equivalent immutable rulesets are almost identical, however their behaviour is different:

```jsx
<h1 class="title">
  color: blue;
</h1>,

<h1 class="warning">
  color: red;
</h1>
```

In immutable styles a ruleset
