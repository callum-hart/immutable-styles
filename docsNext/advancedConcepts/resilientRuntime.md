# Resilient Runtime

The CSS generated by immutable styles is very resiliant to changes in HTML. This means adding or removing a class, using different class combinations or changing the structure of HTML does not introduce previously non-exisitant overrides.

CSS on the otherhand is very sensitive to changes in HTML. For example:

```html
<style>
  .title {
    color: royalblue;
  }

  .warning {
    color: orangered;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="title">I am royalblue</h1>
<h1 class="warning">I am orangered</h1>
```

In the example above both rulesets contain a `color` declaration. When each class is used independantly the color of each target element is predictable â€“ the heading with the class `title` is royalblue and the heading with the class `warning` is orangered.

However if the HTML changes and the element uses both classes (combining `title` and `warning`), one of the `color` declarations will override the other:

```html
<h1 class="title warning">I am orangered</h1>
```

The heading currently has the color `orangered`, however a change in specificity, cascade position or importance changes the outcome:

```html
<style>
  h1.title {
    color: royalblue;
  }

  .warning {
    color: orangered;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="title warning">I am now royalblue</h1>
```

<center>*</center>

The equivalent immutable rulesets are almost identical, however their behaviour is different:

```jsx
<h1 className="title">
  color: royalblue;
</h1>,

<h1 className="warning">
  color: orangered;
</h1>
```

Immutable styles treats all selectors explicitly. This means the selector `<h1 className="title">` *only* targets elements, of type `h1` that have the class `title`. Likewise the selector `<h1 className="warning">` *only* targets elements of type `h1` with the class `warning`.

The combination of both classes (using `title` and `warning`) represents a different state and therefore should be handled explicitly:

```jsx
<h1 className="title.warning">
  color: orangered;
</h1>
```
