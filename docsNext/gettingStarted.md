# Getting Started

## Beginner Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce immutable styles in a *hopefully* accessible way.

This tutorial will use a fictitious food app to demonstrate how immutable styles is used for styling web interfaces. For the sake of berevity we will focus on styling a single part of the app ‚Äì the restaurant card, which displays information for a given restaurant:

*screenshot of restaurant card*

Although fairly trivial, the restaurant card provides the perfect fit for illustrating the basic concepts of immutable styles without getting distracted by unnecessary and excessive details.

### Setup

The first step is to clone the [turorial]():

```
git clone ....immutable-styles-beginner-tutorial
cd immutable-styles-beginner-tutorial
npm install
```

Then start the application:

```
npm start
```

In its current state the restaurant card looks rather unappetizing since its markup is unstyled.

The files we are interested in are: src/RestaurantCard.jsx ‚Äì which contains the restaurant cards markup and: src/RestaurantCard.**iss.jsx** ‚Äì which *will* contain the restaurant cards styles.

You may have noticed `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` uses a dual file extension of `.iss.jsx`. The first part ‚Äì `iss` stands for Immutable Style Sheets (or ISS for short). This naming convension allows the compiler to efficiently identify Immutable Style Sheets ‚Äì whilst preserving JSX syntax highlighting.

> üí°Note: although this tutorial uses React, it should be noted that immutable styles is markup agnostic ‚Äì meaning it isn‚Äôt coupled or biased to a specific way of generating HTML. Just like a CSS pre-processor ‚Äì immutable styles generates CSS which can be used on any website ‚Äì rendered server or client-side.

### Boilerplate

`RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` currently contains boilerplate code typical of any Immutable Style Sheet:

```jsx
1|  /** @jsx createStyle */
2|  import { createStyle } from 'immutable-styles';
3|
4|  module.exports = [];
```

Line 2 imports `createStyle` from immutable styles ‚Äì which is a function that generates immutable rulesets. On line 1 the `createStyle` function is mapped to JSX ‚Äì meaning any JSX tags in this file will be transpiled to `createStyle` function calls. Line 4 *will* export our immutable rulesets.

### Styling the restaurant card

We are going to create our first immutable ruleset. Since this is the first lets make it special ‚Äì we will style the restaurants star rating ‚≠êÔ∏è.

Replace line 4 of  `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` with the following snippet:

```jsx
module.exports = [
  <div className="stars">
    margin-bottom: 10px;

    <span>
      margin-right: 2px;
      font-size: 20px;
      color: gold;
    </span>
  </div>
];
```

Save the file ‚Äì and you should see the following:

*screenshot of progress so far*

Next, lets focus on the layout of the restaurant card. The details ‚Äì rating, name, opening time and summary ‚Äì should sit to the right of the image. Add the following to `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx`:

```jsx
module.exports = [
  <section className="card">
    display: flex;
  </section>,

  <div className="details">
    flex: 1;
    margin-left: 15px;
  </div>,

  <div className="stars">
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
];
```

With the ruleset for the restaurant card in place lets make it look nicer. Replace lines 5 to 7 with the following snippet:

```jsx
<section className="card">
  display: flex;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 2px 0 lightgrey;
</section>,
```

And finally, lets spruce up the typography:

```jsx
<h3>
  margin: 15px 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
</h3>,

<p>
  margin: 10px 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: slategrey;
</p>
```

So far, all restaurants in our app will have a five star rating. Sadly, in the real world this isn't always the case ‚Äì some restaurants get a three star rating. Lets update both the markup and styling accordingly.

Firstly, lets change the stars default color from `gold` to `lightgrey`:

```jsx
<div className="stars">
  {/* ... */}

  <span>
    {/* ... */}
    color: lightgrey;
  </span>
</div>
```

Now, in `RestaurantCard.jsx` add the classname "shining" to the top three stars:

```jsx
10| <div className="stars">
11|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
12|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
13|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
14|   <span>‚òÖ</span>
15|   <span>‚òÖ</span>
16| </div>
```

If you save the file ‚Äì you will notice the first three stars are unstyled:

*screenshot of progress so far*

This is to be expeceted. Immutable styles treat type selectors ‚Äì in this case `<span>` ‚Äì and selectors with a class ‚Äì in this case `<span className="shining">` as different selectors ‚Äì *even though* they target the same element type. The type selector `<span>` only targets elements of type `span` that do not have a class. Elements of type `span` with a class ‚Äì such as "shining" need to be styled individually. This is a *key difference* between immutable styles and CSS ‚Äì and is one of the things that make immutable rulesets highly deterministic. Styles for a `span` without a class **are not applied** to a `span` with a class.

With that in mind, lets us now add styles for stars with the class "shining":

```jsx
<div className="stars">
  {/* ... */}

  <span>
    {/* ... */}
  </span>

  <span className="shining">
    margin-right: 2px;
    font-size: 20px;
    color: gold;
  </span>
</div>
```

> üí°Note: you may have noticed 2/3rds of the CSS declarations for `<span>` and `<span className="shining">` are the same ‚Äì with each ruleset containing both `margin-right` and `font-size`. Immutable styles provides ways to remove duplicate styles ‚Äì aiding reuse among similar rulesets ‚Äì however these won't be introduced yet in the interests of not overcomplicating this tutorial.

The restaurant card is looking pretty good so far, however it's currently a bit static. It would be nice to add a hover effect and make sure the layout is optimized for mobile devices.

Firstly lets add the hover effect, which is achieved using the **`pseudo`** JSX attribute (previously introduced in ["The Basics"]()):

```jsx
<section className="card">
  {/* ... */}
  transition: all .15s ease-in-out;
</section>,

<section className="card" pseudo=":hover">
  background: ivory;
  cursor: pointer;
  transform: scale(1.02);
</section>,
```

Now, lets optimize the restaurant card for mobile using the **`maxWidth`** JSX attribute:

```jsx
<section className="card" maxWidth="600">
  margin: 0 20px;

  <img className="image">
    display: none;
  </img>
</section>,
```

Finally lets tighten up the spacing, to allow more content to fit on smaller screen-sizes:

```jsx
<section className="card" maxWidth="600">
  {/* ... */}
  padding: 10px;

  <img className="image">
    {/* ... */}
  </img>

  <div className="details">
    margin-left: 0;
  </div>
</section>,
```

If you save the file and open up the browsers console you will see an error has be thrown: `[Override Found] The property `padding` has already been defined`, and the newly added styles have not been applied. Navigate to your terminal window and you will see the following compile time error:

```
[Override Found]

The property `padding` is defined here:
  /Users/callum-hart/Desktop/testingISS/src/beginnerTutorial/RestaurantCard.iss.jsx:7:5

  5 |   <section className="card">
  6 |     display: flex;
> 7 |     padding: 15px;
          ^^^^^^^

And again here:
  /Users/callum-hart/Desktop/testingISS/src/beginnerTutorial/RestaurantCard.iss.jsx:22:5

  20 |   <section className="card" maxWidth="600">
  21 |     margin: 0 20px;
> 22 |     padding: 10px;
           ^^^^^^^

The first occurrence is overridden by the second.
```

As the error message shows the `padding` has been defined twice. The `padding` set in the first occurance (line 7) is applied to the card on *all* screen-sizes. The `padding` set in the second occurance (line 22) is applied to the card on screens narrower than 600px. This means on screen widths between 0px and 600px the `padding` property is defined twice ‚Äì which *would* result in an override, if it weren't for the compiler catching it.
