# Getting Started

## Beginner Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce immutable styles in a *hopefully* accessible way.

This tutorial will use a fictitious food app to demonstrate how immutable styles is used for styling web interfaces. For the sake of berevity we will focus on styling a part of the app ‚Äì the restaurant card, which displays information for a given restaurant:

Although fairly trivial, the restaurant card provides the perfect fit for illustrating the basic concepts of immutable styles without getting distracted by unnecessary and excessive details.

### Setup

The first step is to clone the [turorial]():

```
git clone ....immutable-styles-beginner-tutorial
cd immutable-styles-beginner-tutorial
npm install
```

Then start the application:

```
npm start
```

In its current state the restaurant card looks rather unappetizing since the markup is unstyled.

The files we are interested in are: src/RestaurantCard.jsx ‚Äì which contains the restaurant cards markup and: src/RestaurantCard.**iss.jsx** ‚Äì which *will* contain the restaurant cards styles.

You may have noticed `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` uses a dual file extension of `.iss.jsx`. The first part ‚Äì `iss` stands for Immutable Style Sheets (or ISS for short). This naming convension allows the compiler to efficiently identify Immutable Style Sheets ‚Äì whilst preserving JSX syntax highlighting.

> üí°Note: although this tutorial uses React, it should be noted that immutable styles is markup agnostic ‚Äì meaning it isn‚Äôt coupled or biased to a specific way of generating HTML. Just like a CSS pre-processor ‚Äì immutable styles generates CSS which can be used on any website ‚Äì rendered server or client-side.

### Boilerplate

`RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` currently contains boilerplate code typical of any Immutable Style Sheet:

```jsx
1|  /** @jsx createStyle */
2|  import { createStyle } from 'immutable-styles';
3|
4|  module.exports = [];
```

Line 2 imports `createStyle` from immutable styles ‚Äì which is a function that generates immutable rulesets. On line 1 the `createStyle` function is mapped to JSX ‚Äì meaning any JSX tags in this file will be transpiled to `createStyle` function calls. Line 4 *will* export our immutable rulesets.

### Styling the restaurant card

We are going to create our first immutable ruleset. Since this is the first lets make it special ‚Äì we will style the restaurants star rating ‚≠êÔ∏è.

Replace line 4 of  `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx` with the following snippet:

```jsx
module.exports = [
  <div className="stars">
    margin: 10px 0;

    <span>
      margin-right: 2px;
      font-size: 18px;
      color: gold;
    </span>
  </div>
];
```

Save the file ‚Äì and you should see the following:

Next, lets focus on the layout of the restaurant card. The details ‚Äì rating, name, opening time and summary ‚Äì should sit to the right of the image. Add the following to `RestaurantCard.iss.jsx`:

```jsx
module.exports = [
  <section className="card">
    display: flex;
  </section>,

  <div className="details">
    flex: 1;
    margin-left: 10px;
  </div>,

  <div className="stars">
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
```

With the ruleset for the restaurant card in place lets add some styles that will make it look nicer. Replace lines 5 to 7 with the following snippet:

```jsx
<section className="card">
  display: flex;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 2px 0 lightgrey;
</section>,
```

And finally, lets spruce up the typography:

```jsx
<h3>
  margin: 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
</h3>,

<p>
  margin: 10px 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: slategrey;
</p>
```

<center>*</center>

So far, all restaurants in our app will have a five star rating. Sadly, in the real world this isn't always the case ‚Äì some restaurants get a three star rating. Lets update both the markup and styling accordingly.

Firstly, lets change the default star color from `gold` to `lightgrey`:

```jsx
<div className="stars">
  {/* ... */}

  <span>
    {/* ... */}
    color: lightgrey;
  </span>
</div>
```

Now, in `RestaurantCard.jsx` add the classname "shining" to the top three stars:

```jsx
10| <div className="stars">
11|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
12|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
13|   <span className="shining">‚òÖ</span>
14|   <span>‚òÖ</span>
15|   <span>‚òÖ</span>
16| </div>
```

If you save the file ‚Äì you will notice the first three stars are unstyled:

*screenshot of progress so far*

This is to be expeceted. Immutable styles treats type selectors ‚Äì in this case `<span>` ‚Äì and selectors with a class ‚Äì in this case `<span className="shining">` as different selectors ‚Äì *even though* they target the same element type. The type selector `<span>` only targets elements of type `span` that do not have a class. Elements of type `span` with a class ‚Äì such as "shining" need to be styled individually. This is one of many *key differences* between immutable styles and CSS, which make immutable rulesets uniquely deterministic.

Lets style the shining stars:

```jsx
<div className="stars">
  {/* ... */}

  <span>
    {/* ... */}
  </span>

  <span className="shining">
    margin-right: 2px;
    font-size: 18px;
    color: gold;
  </span>
</div>
```

You may have noticed 2/3 of CSS declarations ‚Äì `margin-right` and `font-size` are the same for both normal and shining stars.
