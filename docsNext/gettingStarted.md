# Getting Started

## Beginner Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce immutable styles in a *hopefully* accessible way.

This tutorial will use a fictitious food app to demonstrate how immutable styles is used for styling web interfaces. For the sake of berevity we will focus on styling a part of the app â€“ the restaurant card, which displays information for a given restaurant.

Although fairly trivial, the restaurant card is a good fit for illustrating the basic concepts of immutable styles without introducing unnecessary and excessive details.
